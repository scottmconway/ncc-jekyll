She is a retired earth science teacher who introduced many students, as well as family and friends, to their first caving experience with a visit to the NCC’s Clarksville Cave. Leslie’s interest in the NCC, as a landowner, is to assist the NCC with its efforts in the areas of conservation and study of caves and karst areas."

  email: "m.berger@necaveconservancy.org"
  biography: "Mitch started caving in 2005, when he first visited Clarksville with the MIT Caving Club. He spent several years leading trips for that club, training new leaders, and occasionally serving as Secretary. He became involved with the NCC in 2012 shortly after being disappointed when his group was denied permission to visit a cave - this sparked his interest in landowner relationships and what's involved in caring for and maintaining a cave preserve for the community to enjoy (the NCC now owns this cave). He's currently manager of the Knox Cave Preserve. A life member of the NSS, he's active in the Boston Grotto, a member of the Helderberg-Hudson Grotto, and has served as Vice Chair and then Chair of the NRO. He caves and digs in the northeast, and occasionally West Virginia."
