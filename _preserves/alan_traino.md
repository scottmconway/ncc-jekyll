topParagraphs:
  - "The Alan Traino Preserve is a karst preserve in Albany County, NY. There are two known caves on the preserve: Slingerlands Hellhole and George's Surprise. These two insurgence caves contain an estimated 2,100 feet of passages and have a voice connection between them. The caves are part of the insurgence complex for the Chatter-Stone-Hole System."
  - "Slingerland's Hellhole is the longer of the two caves with about 1450 feet of passage. The entrance to the cave is in a slot in a sinkhole with a small stream. After a 15 ft climbdown into the entrance, there is a wet section with a low ceiling. After 50 feet there will start to be more headroom, with low standing passage, stoopwalks, crawls, and a decorated flowstone hall ahead. There are several sections with delicate rimstone and speleothems - cave softly to avoid damaging these delicate formations."
  - "George's surprise is the other small cave of note and isn't far from the Slingerland's entrance, a few minutes to the south. If you are inclined to go through both caves, consider going to George's Surprise first as it is the smaller and often less wet. A trip through both caves may get easier soon!"
  - "For more information about the cave and instructions on how to visit the preserve, please contact the preserve manager at [traino_preserve@necaveconservancy.org](mailto:traino_preserve@necaveconservancy.org)"
  - "Special use groups such as summer camps, church groups, scouts, and school groups are asked to contact the [NCC special use coordinators](mailto:specialuse@necaveconservancy.org) to schedule trips into the caves."
