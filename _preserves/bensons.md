topParagraphs:
  - "The Bensons Cave Preserve is in Schoharie County NY and was donated to the NCC by the US Cave Conservancy in 2014."

  - "Bensons Cave is the downstream portion of Secret Caverns, a commercial cave. The two caves together have just under 6200 feet (1890 m) of passage. The main entrance to the cave is a pit entrance with a 65-foot drop. The drop is free rappel. North of Bensons Pit the cave is a mix of hands and knees crawl and walking passage with many formations. Eventually, a wet crawl is reached. In some of the older descriptions this is called Ladies Limit. Beyond this, one reaches the Junction Room. There is a 4-foot drop into the room. This is where the passage from Secret Caverns enters from the NNW. The main cave continues east and south."

  - "Visitors to the Bensons Cave Preserve are required to obtain a parking permit and to follow the guidelines listed below. Visitors who fail to obtain a parking permit or abide by these guidelines are considered to be trespassing and are subject to arrest."

  - "The parking permit is available from the property managers via email and will be printed on NCC letterhead. The names of the trip participants must be written onto the permit, and the permit should be clearly displayed on the dashboard of a car vehicle."
