topParagraphs:
  - "Sellecks Karst Preserve is located off of Kniskern Road in the town of Carlisle in Schoharie County, New York. The preserve was purchased by the NCC in 2002 and contains about 15 acres of land and four known caves."
  - "The largest of the caves is Sellecks Cave with approximately 1000 feet of passage. The entrance to the cave is in an impressive sinkhole and opens into a large room at the base of a twenty foot entrance drop. The drop is not climbable and requires vertical gear to enter and exit the cave. At the center of the room a stream cuts through the cave which has been dye traced to the Northwest Passage in nearby McFails Cave. This stream quickly sumps upstream but has been dove approximately 700 feet. Heading downstream the stream disappears through inaccessible cracks."
  - "Levys Cave is a small stream insurgence cave which takes large amounts of water during the spring. The cave is about 200 feet long and has a twelve foot drop inside the cave that requires a rope or cable ladder."
  - "Cave 575 is a small pit cave with a 15 foot entrance drop requiring a rope. Once inside the cave the rest of the cave can be accessed by climbing. The cave is notable for the impressive display of fossils in the walls."
  - "The fourth cave on the property is Natural Bridge Cave, a small natural bridge of limestone at the bottom of a large sinkhole."
