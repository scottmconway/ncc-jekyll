topParagraphs:
  - "Merlins Cave Preserve consists of 35 acres and is located in the town of Canaan in Columbia County, New York."  
  - "Merlins Cave currently exists in nearly pristine condition. Therefore, all trips require a trained Cave Steward who is thoroughly familiar with the cave and as participated in Steward-training exercises. In addition all trips are at the discretion of the Preserve Managers. Steward trainings are held periodically and will be announced via the NRO/NSS and Northeastern Cave Conservancy list-serves."
  - "Cavers visiting Merlins cave should be aware of areas marked by caution tape, as these areas are either particularly fragile or unstable. A trail is marked from the parking area past the Dragon Bones Cave entrance to the Merlins Cave entrance. Established trails should be used to access the caves."
  - "Due to the nature of the cave, at this time institutional users may give surface tours of the property only. Please contact the NCC special use coordinators for more information."
