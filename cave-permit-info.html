    - All caves require that you follow standard safe and conservation minded caving practices.
    - There are no bathroom facilities at NCC preserves. Please plan ahead. The NCC supports the principles of [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles).
    - The [National Speleological Society, Inc. (NSS)](https://www.caves.org) and the [Northeastern Cave Conservancy, Inc. (NCC)](https://www.necaveconservancy.org/) are completely separate 501(c)(3) organizations. Both are staffed by volunteers. Neither charge a fee for use of their properties but are happy to receive donations at the addresses listed below. We have combined this information to help make your visits to these caves easier.
    - Contact your local caving club through [caves.org](https://caves.org/find-a-grotto/) if you are looking for a guide as they may be able to help you.
    - Please refer to individual preserve pages for permit requirements for each preserve.
    - For special use groups such as summer camps, church groups, scouts, and school groups, please contact the [NCC special use coordinators](specialuse@necaveconservancy.org) to schedule trips into the caves. Insurance or certificate thereof may be required for these groups, and they may be required to show proof that they are complying with their own rules regarding caving. A PDF version of the NCC special use group form requirements can be found [here](/assets/documents/2019-NCC-Form-requirements.pdf).
