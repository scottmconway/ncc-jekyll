<p class="big">I don’t know how you would confirm the above statement from the NSS website, however it does mirror my personal observations of the numbers of cavers willing to donate time and effort to a wide range of cave related activities. Cavers will spend countless hours above and below ground working to improve, conserve, and/or better understand karst features. Sometimes this volunteer work is officially recognized and applauded by the land owner, the community or a governmental entity. But mostly cavers do the work just for the opportunity to explore, understand and protect the unknown. In the mid nineties, the Federal Government proposed “user fees” to help overcome budget deficits. This would have resulted in cavers paying a fee to an agency to locate, explore and map caves on federal lands. In 1998 the NSS entered into an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990129003422/http://www.caves.org:80/nss-business/bog/app-an.html" target="_blank">agreement</a> with the USDA Forest Service  to define the valve of the volunteer work cavers donated to the Service. The monetary value of the volunteer work negated paying user fees. Since that time Volunteer Value (VV) has </p>

<p class="big">Northeast cavers have a 50+ year history of working to understand and preserve karst features in the region. More recently, the NCC has taken the lead in the protection, exploration, scientific investigation, conservation, and preservation of cave and karst resources in our area. Besides owning several properties, the NCC manages property for other agencies, has made presentations to local governments concerning land use, contributed to environmental impact studies, and advised local property owners on living with their karst properties. All of this work has and continues to be done by volunteers. By assigning dollar values to our volunteer work and adding up</p>
