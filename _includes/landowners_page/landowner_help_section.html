<h5>The Northeastern Cave Conservancy may be able to help:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Donation of Property</b> - The Northeastern Cave Conservancy is a 501(c)-3 tax exempt organization. Property donations can provide you with a significant tax savings. </li>
 
<li>
<b>Conservation Easement</b> - A conservation easement is a binding legal agreement between the land owner and the conservancy. It permanently restricts the use of the land in order to promote conservation. In exchange, the landowner can gain a tax advantage. No public access is required, and the owner can continue to own the land, pass it on to heirs, or sell it. The conservation restrictions stay with the property. Each easement is different, and is specifically tailored to the property. The Land Trust Alliance has a nice website explaining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220909113154/https://landtrustalliance.org/node/106" target="_blank">conservation easements</a>. </li>
 
<li>
<b>Purchase</b> - The Northeastern Cave Conservancy also purchases significant cave properties. Please look at our selection criteria on our <a href="/preserves/">cave preserve</a> page. </li>
 
<li>
<b>Management Plan</b> - The NCC can survey your cave, and tell you where it runs under the land, and more importantly, where it doesn't! We can evaluate your cave and help develop a cave management plan. This will let you know what your resources are, and will give you suggestions on how to take care of them. </li>
</ul>
